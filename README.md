# OSIRIS

CMS for image galleries. 

Features posting, editing, removing and categorizing images (as albums); uploading and removing images.

Back-end part is made with PHP/Zend Expressive. Front-end is made with React.js. MySQL database.

I like this project. It's small, convenient and helped me avoid the use of an external CMS system that probably has more functions than I need.

# GENERAL

- One Admin user, the password is hashed but not stored in a database, because it saved me a bit of extra work.
- Login
- Adding image galleries
- Removing images or whole galleries
- Adding images to existing galleries
- Editing everything that can be edited, title, description
- Thumbnail creation for images 
- A little form to search for galleries
- React, a little bit of Redux


UI/UX was not the focus of this project.
